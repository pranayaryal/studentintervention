# Project 2: Supervised Learning
## Building a Student Intervention System


This is a classification problem which tries to predict whether a student would pass or fail based on the supplied parameters. We compare three algorithms - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines

The model giving the highest accuracy is chosen. We apply a Grid Search cross validation to tune the hyperparameter lambda which is a regularization parameter for the logistic regression algorithm.
